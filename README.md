# OpenHPI Let's Git Class

This is a repository, which was developed during the [OpenHPI Let's Git Class](https://open.hpi.de/courses/git2020) in June 2020. The goal of this MOOC was to teach the basics of Git as a version control and also the contribution to Open Source projects (with focus on GitHub).
